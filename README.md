# Trend Analysis with PM data

This is an attempt at calculating PM trends with Environment Canterbury data. There are two ways shown here:

1. Using an automatic request grabbing data through the [data.ecan.govt.nz](https://data.ecan.govt.nz/) website
2. Using a .csv file with data located in the `/data` folder

The automatic request is preferred at the moment as hopefully it saves some time in the future if the trends need to be recalculated for other time periods or rerun if the data changes.
